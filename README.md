Dataset: PIMA Indians Diabetes - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

-Task 1: Perform logistic regression from scratch for classification of diabetes diagnosis.

-Task 2: Create a Neural Network from scratch to classify whether the patient has diabetes or not.

-Task 3: Implement different regularization techniques on you Neural Network.
